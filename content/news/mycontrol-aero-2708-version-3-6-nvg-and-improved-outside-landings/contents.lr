body:

This version improves handing of outside landings:

  * The location search form has been optimized for smaller devices.
  * The last two outside landings are now provided as shortcuts in the flight view.
  * The outside location field provides autocomplete: Just start typing the name of an already used outside landing!

Version 3.6 also brings support for night vision googles for professional
helicopter pilots. To use the additional NVG field on flights and past
experience, enable the night vision goggles option in the preferences.

The new features are rolled out and available for you. No installation on your
side is needed. Enjoy logging your flights with myControl.aero.
