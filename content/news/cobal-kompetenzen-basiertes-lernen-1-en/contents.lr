description: COBAL (Competency Based Learning) is a web application to manage and to keep record of students learning progress and their progress in different school projects.
---
body:

It is designed as an interactive forum where they can note goals, reflect on
objectives or achieved competencies as well as document successfull projects.  
As it is interactive, it allows communication between students about their
projects and thus to motivate each other. Teachers can take part too and
evaluate their students individual progress.  
For each project, the teacher can define curricular competencies the students
have to achieve. By tagging specific items which indicate the achieved
competencies, students will be able to keep record of their individual
proceedings and share them with their fellow students.
